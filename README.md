# Summery About App

Develop a mobile application in Flutter that interfaces with the API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) to display a list of posts. The initial background color of each row in the list should be set to light yellow. When a user clicks on any post, it should open a new detail screen using the API endpoint , where {postId} is the ID of the selected post.
## Description
I have implemented a Flutter app that displays a user list fetched from an API on the home screen. Each list item contains an independent timer that starts when the item becomes visible on the screen and pauses automatically when it goes out of view. When a user opens a list item, it is marked as read and the background turns white, while unread items remain highlighted in light yellow.

This project uses http, shared_preferences, visibility_detector, and flutter_spinkit to deliver fast performance, smooth state handling, and a clean user experience.
